## General Info

This is a DCI end of chapter project. This project is an object oriented school system made using javascript programming language.

The project is designed as classes, functions, modules, states. In particular, its modular structure has made the codes reusable and made the system more understandable.

One of the important features of the project is to keep the system running continuously by catching possible error situations.

## Preview

There are three main groups in the system. These:

     - Director
     - Teachers
     - Students.

These people can do their own operations on their own pages. For example, while the director can create a new class, this is not possible for the student.

There are also common operations such as changing passwords, sending messages and accessing personal information.
